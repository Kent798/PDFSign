PDFSign
=======

I wrote this project as a simple demonstration of how to add a signature to a PDF in iOS. Are put together examples of Apple (http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/ZoomingPDFViewer/Introduction/Intro.html) and the project Smooth-Line-View by Levi Nunnink (https://github.com/levinunnink/Smooth-Line-View)
